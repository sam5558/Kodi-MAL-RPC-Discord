# Kodi-RPC-Discord

Do you want a simple python script that'll give your discord community an idea about what show you're watching in Kodi ? If the answer is yes you're on the right place.

Right now this script has been tested only in linux with Python 3.6+, any environment other than this one hasn't been tested.
You also need to know that i've targeted only **TV SHOWS**, still didn't have time to work on **Movies** section, **Live TV** or **Music** :( 

# Prerequisites

You need to :
* Install Python3.5+
* Install python dependencies (pip -i dependencies.txt)
* Discord Desktop app should be installed and running

# How to use it

* Create your own application in the [DEVELOPER PORTAL](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/), you can customize your app there (add image, icons, ...)
* Enable your web UI in Kodi (basically your 8080 port as it is done by adding a web interface for Kodi) 
* Play your content in **TV SHOWS**
* execute the script ```
python3.5 UpdateStatus.py```

# Enjoy
